# Spelling Bee Application
This web app replicates a spelling bee game. The user can play as many times as they want with continuously randomized words.

## Goals
The goal of this branch is to add the following features revolving around users:
 
* Users can sign in using an email/username and password so that they can keep track of their progress.
* I will add mongoDB functionality so that Users can view how many games of each difficulty they have won and what their success rate is with each difficulty.
* Users can compare their results to people around the world.
* Users can provide feedback and suggestions for me to make.
* Users can possibly add custom themes and avatars to their profile.
